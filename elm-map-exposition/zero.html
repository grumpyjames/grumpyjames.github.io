<h3>What is elm?</h3>

<p>and why am I using it?</p>

<p>Elm is "a delightful language for reliable webapps", according to <a href="http://www.elm-lang.org">the official website</a>.</p>

<p>For me, Elm is the answer to the following series of questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can't we write just reliable webapps in javascript?</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, but it is <em>hard</em>. <code>undefined</code> is not a <code>function</code>, we hear.</p>

<p>It's hard enough that a great deal of effort has been expended
creating build pipelines for javascript webapps to make things easier.</p>

<p>Wait, <em>build</em> pipelines? Isn't javascript interpreted? If we're going
to preprocess our javascript, why don't we write in a language that
compiles to javascript, but hates freedom less/kills fewer kittens, etc?</p>

<p>What would we want that language to look like?</p>

<h3>My language bucket list</h3>

<ul>
<li>Statically typed</li>
<li>Immutability by default</li>
<li>Functions over objects</li>
<li>Exceptions are bugs, not design choices</li>
<li>No null</li>
<li>No eval</li>
</ul>

<p>Those things exclude a few others.</p>

<p>If we're statically typed, we're not going to want to construct <code>DOM</code> nodes from strings, so we're going to need an excellent <code>dsl</code> for describing them.</p>

<p>We're going to need a language that's going to make it easy to write code that parses json into types. It's going to have to make handling failure cases simple, too.</p>

<p>Elm ticks every single one of those boxes, and then adds even more bells and whistles on top.</p>

<h3>So, about elm...</h3>

<p>It's statically <em>and</em> strongly typed. Moving between types must always be explicit, there is no coercion. </p>

<p>It doesn't just prefer immutability - it requires it. Unless we start writing native modules, elm won't allow mutation <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p>How the hell do we write a webapp where anything changes, then? Well, elm isn't really just a language. It also provides an architecture (although I'd be more tempted to call it a runtime) and an excellent standard library.</p>

<h3>Behind the curtain: the elm architecture</h3>

<p>elm grandly claims we can write a whole webapp with only four ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>a type, <code>Model</code>, representing the 'state' of our app. This is usually an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type">ADT</a>, but it could just be a <code>String</code>. We'll provide an initial value for this state, <code>initialModel</code>.</li>
<li>another type, <code>Msg</code>, that defines what events our application will respond to</li>
<li>a function, <code>update: Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; Model</code>. Given an event and the current state, produce the new state.</li>
<li>another function, <code>view: Model -&gt; Html Msg</code>. Given this state, produce a <code>Html</code> view.</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll note that the return type of <code>view</code> is parameterized by our event type. This means that our resulting <code>Html</code> has hooks within it to trigger 'Msg' events based on user interactions, like a mouse click.</p>

<p>Under the covers, elm is running an event loop something like this:</p>

<pre><code>
var model = initialModel;
var currentView = view(initialModel);
applyToDom(currentView);
while (true) {
    var event = events.poll();
    model = update(event, model);
    var newView = view(model);
    applyDiffToDom(diff(currentView, newView));
    currentView = newView;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've represented that in terrible javascript pseudocode in the spirit of comprehensibility. I suspect that in reality there is not a queue, but a callback; this isn't going to be too important for this discussion though.</p>

<p>We've used some functions I haven't defined: <code>applyToDom</code>, <code>diff</code> and <code>applyDiffToDom</code>. The first of these takes the elm representation of our view and makes the DOM reflect it. The second, <code>diff</code> takes two elm view representations and computes the differences between them. The third, <code>applyDiffToDom</code> takes the resulting diff and applies it to the real DOM.</p>

<p>Whence events? Well, the Html return type returned from view has event sending attributes buried within it. <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/user_input/buttons.html">This demo</a> from the official documentation is the easiest to follow example.</p>

<p>Convinced? Good. Let's build something with elm.</p>
